You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```python
# Define a Fibonacci function
def foo(n):
    if n < 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * foo(n - 1)

# Entry
if __name__ == '__main__':
    fib_n = foo(10)
    print("Fib(10) = %d" % fib_n)
```
